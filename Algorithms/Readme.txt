=== Description =======

The GetFactorial method calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer n. It throws an ArgumentException if n is negative.

The FormatSeparators method formats a list of strings by inserting commas and "and" as appropriate. If the input array is null or empty, it returns an empty string. If the input array contains one element, it returns that element. If the input array contains two elements, it returns the two elements separated by "and". Otherwise, it returns the first n-1 elements separated by commas, followed by "and", followed by the last element.
